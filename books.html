    <h2>All time favorite</h2>
    <p> I enjoy a wide range of books and I am particularly into 19th-century French literature. 19th century is a dynamic period in France history that saw the rise of Democracy and the fitful end of Monarchy and Empire. The first part of the century was dominated by Romanticism, until around the mid-century Realism emerged. In the last half of the century, there were Symbolism and Naturalism. </p>

    <p> For Romanticism, I like Hugo's <i>Notre-Dame de Paris</i>. </p>
    <p> For Realism, I love Flaubert's <i>Madame Bovary</i> and Stendhal's <i>The Red and the Black</i>. </p>
    <p> For Naturaism, I love Maupassant's short stories and Zola's <i>Nana</i>. </p>

    <p> In fact, I think I am generally interested in the 19th century. I also love American novelist Dreiser's <i>Sister Carrie</i>, Hawthorne's <i>The Scarlet Letter</i>, and British novelist Thackeray's <i>The Luck of Barry Lyndon</i>, which are around the same era. </p>
    <p>I may explain the reasons why I love the books or the era in the future : ) </p>

    <h2>Current reading list</h2>

    <p> <i>Guns, Germs, and Steel</i>: In an attempt to explain divergence of human evolution history, Diamond argues that the gaps in power and technology between human societies originate primarily in environmental difference, instead of inherent genomes. I love this book not only because of the intriguing subject but also its methodologies. Diamond asks many deep questions and reveals many contra intuitive findings. </p>
    <p> <i>City of Thives</i>: A historical fiction novel under the setting of WWII Siege of Leningrad. The story is about a looter and deserter trying to find a dozen eggs for the Colonel's daughter's wedding. Benoiff offers an unrealistically realistic portray of the Russia under WWII and finds a good deal of humor amid the grisly absurdities of wartime. </p>

    <h2>Recommendations</h2>
    <p> <i>In Hoffa's Shadow</i>: The legendary labor leader, Mafia, and survelliance. </p>
