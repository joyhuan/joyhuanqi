## Milestone 1

Make the case for your decisions using concepts from class, as well as other design principles, theories, examples, and cases from outside of class. You can use bullet points and lists, or full paragraphs, or a combo, whichever is appropriate. The writing should be solid draft quality but doesn't have to be fancy.

### Target Audience (Milestone 1)

Potential employers, graduate school admission officers, peers.

### Feel and Features (Milestone 1)

Feel: Convey my willing to learn and competence of the job requirements.

Features: Display my skills and past experiences


### Final Content (Milestone 1)

 My skills and past experiences, contact information, and maybe put some links to my Github repo and images/demos/interactive interfaces for the game that I design to help potential employers to visualize the projects on my resume.

## Milestone 2

Make the case for your decisions using concepts from class, as well as other design principles, theories, examples, and cases from outside of class.

Each section is probably around 1 reasonably sized paragraph (3-5 sentences).

### Target Audience (Milestone 2)

The audiences are potential employees or admission officers for grad schools. They are interested in my experiences, demos of my projects so that they know my skills.


### Site Theme (Milestone 2)

The theme would be serious and academic. This is appropriate for the audience because the theme shows that I am professional.

### Navigation (Milestone 2)

Projects and researches are the two most important aspects of activities. So I make a separate webpage for each of them and include a link among the two webpages and the home page to make the navigation easier.

### Organization (Milestone 2)

In the homepage everything is pretty compact and has 3-5 sentences of high-level summary. Then I show a link to each of the individual part of my activities, and in the webpages for each activity, I have the chance to elaborate more.


## Milestone 3

Make the case for your decisions using concepts from class, as well as other design principles, theories, examples, and cases from outside of class.

Remember to focus on the things we can't see just by looking at the site: changes, alternatives considered, processes, and justifications.

Each section is probably around 1 reasonably sized paragraph (3-5 sentences).

### Changes from Milestone 2 (Milestone 3)

So for Milestone 2 there were still some redundant information and the navigation logic was not so clear. I changed the content and reorganize the sequence of different sections to make my website more readable.

### Visual Design (Milestone 3)

For v1, I chose my font-family to be "Georgia","Times New Roman",Serif. This is because the font looks somehow similar to the codes appear on a IDE. I also chose the background color to be dark blue to convey a sense of calm and mystery because I think this is how some people perceive as the image of a hacker.

For v2, I chose my font-family to be "Times", "Times New Roman", SERIF because I think this is the professional font. I also use a plain white background to convey the feeling of seriousness and efficiency.

### Emotion (Milestone 3)

For v1, I want to convey a sense of nerdy developer. I think the style would be more appropriate in a professional or personal context.

For v2, I want to convey a sense of calm and simplicity. I think the style would be more appropriate in a academic or professional context.


## Final Submission - Rationale

This rationale should be polished writing: one you might submit as a report to a client or boss to help explain the project and convince them you did a good job. You'll be surprised how much writing and communicating you need to do about projects and choices on internships and jobs; practice that here.

It should be a comprehensive, complete story of the project. You might find that each section run several paragraphs (1-3). Sketches can often help tell the story of your design. Screenshots are also useful for describing issues discovered during user testing and how you addressed them. Quotes from your users during testing are also very powerful when explaining your rationale.

Your rationale should be a polished version of the earlier rationales.

### Changes from Milestone 3 (Final Submission)

- Changes since Milestone 3 and why, particularly ones you learned from testing.

Problem 1 (Structure): So based on the feedback of the peer review, I realized that the structure of my website in Milestone 3 was quite confusing. One big problem is that there are many repeating sessions. For instance, in the milestone 3 I submitted, there was a navigation bar for both research and project on the top of the main index page that directs to their own webpages. However, there were also sub-sections for research and project in the main index page that provide more details.

Solution 1: So in the final submission I decided to delete the sub-sections for research and project and only leave the navigation bar so that the audience could go to their own separate page and get the information including a generalization, illustration graphs, and more detailed explanation.   

Problem 2 (Content): So when I deleted the branch research and project in the main page, I found that I needed to change the other two sub sections - contests and work experience in the main page as well. This is because I think Research, Projects, Work, and Contests because I think they are four major aspects of my experience and of the same importance.

Solution 2: So I decided to add two more webpages for Contests and Work. Now my main page has four sections in the navigation bar instead of two in my Milestone 3 submission. Then the main page only has About me, What I do for fun, and Contact sections. This is not sufficient and appropriate for the main page given that potential employees care more about my skills instead of my hobbies. So I added Skills, Languages, and Highlighted Courses sections to the main page.

### Audience (Final Submission)

[A complete and polished description of the intended audience(s) for your website.]

Potential employers, graduate school admission officers, and peers who want to know more about my experiences and skills.


### Design Goals (Final Submission)

[An explanation of the design goals for that audience, based on your earlier rationales.]

Content: I want to show my skills and experiences with both breadth and depth. On one hand, I want to cover all four categories of my past experiences; on the other hand, I want each aspect to be covered in more details so I make a webpage for each of them.

Theme: I want my webpage to be serious and academic. This is appropriate for the audience because the theme shows that I am professional.

### Navigation (Final Submission)

[An explanation of how the final navigation met your goals and why its appropriate for your audience(s).]

So I put a navigation bar on top of each of the five webpages so that each page could link to the rest of the pages. The order is kept the same for all the pages.

It is appropriate for the audience because different audience could select the link that they are more interested in. For instance, a grad school admission officer might care more about my researches so they could directly navigates to the research page after learning my basic information in the main page. On the other hand, employers care more about industry experiences so that they could skip my researches and directly go to the work experience page.

### Organization (Final Submission)

[An explanation of how the final organization met your goals and why its appropriate for your audience(s).]

I have six subsections in the main page, including About me, Skills, Languages, Highlighted Coursework, What I do for fun, and Contact because I believe these are the information that all the audience would like to know in the first place.

Then in the separate webpages when I explain a project, I tried to first give a brief overview of what we did, and then provide an illustration graph is possible, and then provide a little more detail about our approach.

This is appropriate for the audience because while it provides more detail than a one-page resume, it does not overwhelm the audience with too many jargons or intimidating equations. I don't want things to be too technical on my personal website because I think a Github link or a tech blog could be more suitable for that. So I decided to use graphs since they help to give a more intuitive comprehension for the audience.

### Visual Design (Final Submission)

[An explanation of how the final design met your goals and why its appropriate for your audience(s).]

I chose my font-family to be: Courier, "Courier New", MONOSPACE. This is because the font looks similar to the codes that appear on an IDE. Also I chose to only use this one font style because I found that other font styles do not really mix well with MONOSPACE and would cause readability problems.

I chose a dark-blue background color to convey a sense of calm and mystery because I think this is how some people perceive software engineers.

I do realize that my page looks kind of plain and lacks variation but that is actually intended. I did try to add more variations to the webpages but I found variations only make the page distracting and dilutes its professional theme.

I think this is appropriate for the audience because it is simple and professional. One potential problem I am thinking about is that I designed that when people hover on a link, the link changes the color from white to pink. This is because pink contrasts well with dark blue; however, pink is considered less professional so it might impair the seriousness of my website. I did tried other colors but it is hard to find a color that is both serious (like grey and black) and contrast well with the dark blue background (bright colors). This is also a major reason why my webpage lacks variations in color. So maybe next time when I choose the color of background, I should also consider how much variation room the background color leave for the texts.
