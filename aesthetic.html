        <p> I studied drawing and piano for years when I was little and continue to
            appreciate the arts and beauties in life since then. </p>

        <h2> Music </h2>
        <p> My favorite Chinese composor is Hai Lin. 林海作曲缠绵悱恻却又荡气回肠，
            绵里藏针，于细微处见深情。有一种即使命运悲剧也满怀热爱的凄壮，对我而言体现了中华民族精神世界的意象。
            This Guzheng piece called <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sFe31-Jmx-M" target="_blank">
            Pipa Language</a> has remained my favorite since when I first heard it at age 10.</p>
        <p> My favorite foreign composer is Chopin. I was speechless when I
        first heard <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9E6b3swbnWg" target="_blank">
        Nocturne op.9 No.2 </a>  Such a divine work! 真切体会到了“曾经沧海难为水，
        除却巫山不是云”和“如听仙乐耳暂明”，以往的音乐一瞬间变得“呕哑嘲哳难为听”。 </p>

        <h2> Painting </h2>
        <p> My favorite Impressionism painter is Renoir. I would fly to Philly just
            to enjoy his paintings. His painting gives me a sense of great joy out
            of no where. Very mysterious and marvelous. </p>
        <p> My favorite Neoclassicism painter is Ingres. His paintings often give me
            the impression that they are too perfect to exist. I was stunned when I
            saw his <i>The Princesse de Broglie</i> for the first time at the Met.
            His <i>Grande Odalisque</i> has long time been my favorite painting. </p>
        <p> Apart from appreciating arts, I also create my own by painting and photography. </p>

        <h2> Cultural Aesthetic </h2>
        <p> Wuxia is one key specialty in Chinese culture. There is some spiritual
        space special for Chinese. It's hard to explain in English and to explain
        to someone who is not grown in this culture. Will come back when I'm
        capable of doing a better job. </p>
        <p> An disclaimer is that aesthetic is very subjective. It only reflects
            my personal point of view/impression. I have not conducted thorough
            research in Chinese culture so if you are serious about learning more
            about Chinesse culture, don't rely solely on my words.
        </p>
        <p> For now I will just share three pieces of music which for me reflects
            the aesthetic of love, destiny, and Wuxia. I first heard all of them
            before I was ten and they left an ingrained influence on me. </p>
