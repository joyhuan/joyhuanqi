# My Personal Website (https://joyhuanqi.com/)

This was Project 1 of CS 1300 Web Design at Cornell. 

# Stage One: Heroku 

I used Heroku Host when I finished the school project. The major two reasons are: 
- It was recommended by the professor (potentially as a way to get around with limitations of Cornell Github; but the limitations are for good reason - Academic Integrity)
- I attended a workshop held by Hubspot which shows how Heruku can process users' input to a backend database in my freshman year. Since then I always wanted to try host something in Heroku. 

However, it has three major drawbacks: 
- It takes really long to load the page 
- I need to pay an annual fee to get https instead of http
- My commits are hidden in my Cornell repo and I need to switch back and forth with my Git accounts 

I was afraid that the first two drawbacks make my website look like a Diaoyu Wangzhan (phising) haha. So I finally decide to change my host from Heroku to Git. 

# Stage Two: Git (Current Stage)

Now I use Git as a host. The load speed is much faster and I can get a https for free :)

# What I learned: 

In the process of changing host, I thought more about how the host works instead of simply following the commands step by step without thinking. The steps then become natural - I need to first unregister my project in Heroku and update the IP to Github. I also learnt some fun common NDS records.  

# Stage Three: Future

Since I'm a utilitarian, I'm not too concerned with the appearance of my website. However, I do care about its features. My current two biggest concerns are:
- It is not very responsive. When viewing on phone, it shows the same layout as in PC. This needs to be adjusted to give a better user experience
- I want to try different web programming technology. React and Spark and Angular JS are in top of my list.
