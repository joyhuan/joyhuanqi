# My Personal Website (https://joyhuanqi.com/)

It originated from Project 1 of CS 1300 Web Design at Cornell. 

## Stage One: Heroku 

I used Heroku Host when I finished the school project. The major two reasons are: 
- It was recommended by the professor
- I attended a Heruku workshop held by Hubspot which showed interactino with backend database in my freshman year, which piqued my interests.

However, it has three major drawbacks: 
- It takes LONG to load, which makes my website look like a phishing website :(
- I need to pay an annual fee to get https instead of http.

## Stage Two: Git (Current Stage)

So I decided to change host from Heroku to Git. The load speed is much faster and I can get https for free :)

## Lesson:

In the process of changing host, I thought more about how the host works instead of following the instruction no brain. The steps become natural - I need to first unregister my project in Heroku and update the IP to Github. I also learnt some fun common NDS records.

## Stage Three: Future

I'm a utilitarian and not too concerned with website appearance. However, the current status is below satisfaction. I finally picked up Angular recently and plan to refurbish the website within the next few months. I will also try to make it more responsive and more user friendly for phone/tablet users.
