# My Personal Website (https://joyhuanqi.com/)

This was Project 1 of CS 1300 Web Design at Cornell. 

## Stage One: Heroku 

I used Heroku Host when I finished the school project. The major two reasons are: 
- It was recommended by the professor (potentially as a way to get around with limitations of Cornell Github; but the limitations are for good reason - Academic Integrity)
- I attended a workshop held by Hubspot which showed how Heruku can process users' input to a backend database in my freshman year. Since then I always wanted to try host something in Heroku. 

However, it has three major drawbacks: 
- It takes really long to load the page 
- I need to pay an annual fee to get https instead of http
- My commits are hidden in my Cornell repo and I need to switch back and forth with my Git accounts 

I was afraid that the first two drawbacks make my website look like a Diaoyu Wangzhan (phising) haha. So I finally decided to change my host from Heroku to Git. 

## Stage Two: Git (Current Stage)

Now I use Git as a host. The load speed is much faster and I can get https for free :)

## Lesson: 

In the process of changing host, I thought more about how the host works instead of simply following the commands step by step without thinking. The steps then become natural - I need to first unregister my project in Heroku and update the IP to Github. I also learnt some fun common NDS records.  

## Stage Three: Future

- I'm a utilitarian and not too concerned with website appearance. However, I'm not satisfied with the current status. I finally picked up Angular recently and plan to refurbish the website within the next few months. I will also try to make it more responsive and more user frienly for phone/tablet users.
